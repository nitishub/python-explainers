    "            Goal of every language is to be able to effectively communicate ideas. This is true of both Python and English. In case of a human language like English, we are trying to communicate ideas to each other. On the other hand, in case of a programming language like Python, we are trying to communicate a set of instructions to a computer so that it can read and act upon it. \n",
    "            \n",
    "            However, no communication can occur if one does not know how to arrange the words to form meaningful sentences. Every language has a set of rules that it's users must understand in order to communicate successfully. Even if you know the meaning of each and every word of a language, you won't be able to communicate much without knowing how to arrange them. In context of a programming languages, syntax is the set of rules that determine what order of words and symbols form a sentence which is meaningful to a computer. By following proper syntax, a programmer can successfully communicate a set of instructions to a computer. \n",
